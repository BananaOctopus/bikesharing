 The graph below titled Trips by Weekday for each Hour, shows that the most popular times for bikes to be rented are in the morning between 7 AM and 10 AM, most likely for peoples daily commutes to work, and 5 PM to 7 PM, also most likely for people on their commutes back home. The weekend, expecially Saturdays seems to be in general, a very busy day with many bike rentals thorought the day between 9 AM and 7 PM.:

The graph below titled Trips By Gender(Weekday per Hour), shows the same sort of timewise trend demostrated in the previous graph, as well as showing that their customer demographics skew more towards men:

 The graph below titled User Trips by Gender by Weekday, demostrating that the most people who use the service are subcribed to the service and mainly male. Most customers, in this case people who are not subscribed to the service, use it mainly on the weekend, whereas the subscribers use the service moreso during the week, mainly as a means to get to and from work:

The map below titled Popular Starting Locations is pretty self explainatory. The larger and more colorful the dot is, the more bikes are rented from the location. The largest dots are probably close to apartment complexes that many people live and who need the bikes to commute.

The map below titled Popular Ending Locations is pretty self explainatory. The larger and more colorful the dot is, the more bikes are returned to the location. This map mirrors the Popular Starting Location map very closely, with manbe a few more returned to the more peripheral locations. The locations of the bikes should be monetored to make sure that bikes dropped off at low rental stations are returned to stations that have high rental rates to ensure that the most bikes are able to be rented out:

Last, but not least, is a pie graph showing the breakdown of the amount of users that are either locate subscribers to the program or customers that do not have a prescription. Based in the pie chart, its safe to say the majority of users are locales who subscribe, which is important to note since who should we market the most to? Locals!:
